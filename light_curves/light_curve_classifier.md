# Light Curve Classifier
***

## Learning Goals
By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:
- do some basic data cleaning and filtering to prepare the data for the ML algorithms
- work with Pandas data frames as a way of storing time domain datasets
- use sktime & pyts algorithms to train a classifier and predict values on a test dataset

## Introduction
This notebook takes output of a previous demo notebook which generates light curves from archival data, does data prep, and runs the light curves through multiple [`sktime`](https://www.sktime.net/en/stable/) classifiers.  We choose to use [sktime](https://www.sktime.net/en/stable/index.html) algorithms beacuse it is a library of many algorithms specifically tailored to time series datasets.  It is based on the sklearn library so syntax is familiar to many users.

The goal of the classifiers is to be able to differentiate changing look active galactic nucleii (CLAGN) from an SDSS quasar sample based on multiband light curves.  CLAGN are quite interested objects in that they appear to change state, but only a few hundred are currently known, and finding them is quite expensive requiring spectroscopic follow up.  Being able to identify CLAGN in existing large samples would allow us to identify a statisitcal sample from which we could better understand the physics of what is occuring in these systems.

The challenges of this time-domain dataset are:
1. Multi-variate = There are multiple bands of observations per target (13+)
2. Unequal length = Each band has a light curve with different sampling than other bands
3. Missing data = Not each object has all observations in all bands

We choose to use a Pandas multiindex dataframe to store and work with the data because it fulfills these requirements:
1. It can handle the above challenges of a dataset = multi-variate, unqueal length with missing data.
2. Multiple targets (multiple rows)
3. Pandas has some built in understanding of time units
4. Can be scaled up to big data numbers of rows (altough we don't push to out of memory structures in this use case)
5. Pandas is user friendly


## Input
Light curve parquet file of multiband light curves from the mulitband_lc.ipynb demo notebook.  The format of the light curves is a Pandas multiindex data frame

A useful reference for what sktime expects as input to its ML algorithms: https://github.com/sktime/sktime/blob/main/examples/AA_datatypes_and_datasets.ipynb

## Output
Trained classifiers as well as estimates of their accuracy and plots of confusion matrices

## Imports
- `pandas` to work with light curve data structure
- `numpy` for numerical calculations
- `matplotlib` for plotting
- `sys` for paths
- `astropy` to work with coordinates/units and data structures
- `tqdm` for showing progress meter
- `sktime` ML algorithms specifically for time-domain data
- `sklearn` general use ML algorthims with easy to use interface

## 1. Read in a dataset of archival light curves

```{code-cell} ipython3
#access structure of light curves made in the light curve notebook
# has CLAGN & SDSS small sample, all bands
#https://drive.google.com/file/d/13RiPODiz2kI8j1OKpP1vfh6ByIUNsKEz/view?usp=share_link

gdd.download_file_from_google_drive(file_id='13RiPODiz2kI8j1OKpP1vfh6ByIUNsKEz',
                                    dest_path='./data/df_lc_458sample.parquet',
                                    unzip=True)

df_lc = pd.read_parquet("./data/df_lc_458sample.parquet")

#get rid of indices set in the light curve code and reset them as needed before sktime algorithms
df_lc = df_lc.reset_index()  
```

## 2. Data Prep
This dataset needs significant work before it can be fed into a ML algorithm

```{code-cell} ipython3
#what does the dataset look like anyway?
df_lc
```

### 2.1 Remove bands with not enough data
For this use case of CLAGN classification, we don't need to include some of the bands
that are known to be sparse.

```{code-cell} ipython3
##what are the unique set of bands included in our light curves
df_lc.band.unique()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
# get rid of some of the bands that don't have enough data for all the sources

bands_to_drop = ["IceCube", "TESS", "FERMIGTRIG", "K2"]
df_lc = df_lc[~df_lc["band"].isin(bands_to_drop)]
```

### 2.2 Combine Labels for a Simpler Classification
All CLAGN start in the dataset as having labels based on their discovery paper.  Because we want one sample with all known CLAGN, change those discoery names to be simply "CLAGN" for all CLAGN, regardless of origin

```{code-cell} ipython3
df_lc['label'] = df_lc.label.str.replace('MacLeod 16', 'CLAGN')
df_lc['label'] = df_lc.label.str.replace('LaMassa 15', 'CLAGN')
df_lc['label'] = df_lc.label.str.replace('Yang 18', 'CLAGN')
df_lc['label'] = df_lc.label.str.replace('Lyu 21', 'CLAGN')
df_lc['label'] = df_lc.label.str.replace('Hon 22', 'CLAGN')
df_lc['label'] = df_lc.label.str.replace('Sheng 20', 'CLAGN')
df_lc['label'] = df_lc.label.str.replace('MacLeod 19', 'CLAGN')
df_lc['label'] = df_lc.label.str.replace('Green 22', 'CLAGN')
df_lc['label'] = df_lc.label.str.replace('Lopez-Navas 22', 'CLAGN')
```

### 2.3 Remove "bad"  data
"bad" includes:
- errant values
- NaNs
- zero flux
- outliers in uncertainty
- objects with not enough flux measurements to make a good light curve
- objects with no measurements in WISE W1 band

#fewer data points.

### 2.4 Missing Data
Some objects do not have light curves in all bands.  Some ML algorithms can handle mising data, but not all, so it would be useful to handle this missing data up front.

There are two options here
1) We will add light curves with zero flux and err values for the missing data.  SKtime does not like NaNs, so we chose zeros.
2) Remove bands which have less data from all objects so that there are no objects with missing data

Functions are inlcuded for both options (for now)

### 2.5  Make all objects and bands have identical time arrays (uniform length and spacing)

It is very hard to find time-domain ML algorithms which can handle non uniform length datasets. Therefore we make them uniform using Pandas [reindex](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.reindex.html) which fills in the uniform length arrays with values according to the method chosen by the user.  We implement a nearest neighbor to fill the arrays.  

try a sklearn regressor to fit the shape of the light curve and do interpolation

Potential other options for uniformizing the time series dataset:
- pandas.dataframe.interpolate with many methods

```{code-cell} ipython3
#what does the dataframe look like at this point in the code?
df_lc
```

```{code-cell} ipython3

df_interpol = uniform_length_spacing(df_lc, final_freq_interpol )
# df_lc_interpol has one row per dict in lc_interpol. time and flux columns store arrays.
# "explode" the dataframe to get one row per light curve point. time and flux columns will now store floats.
df_lc = df_interpol.explode(["time", "flux","err"], ignore_index=True)
df_lc = df_lc.astype({col: "float" for col in ["time", "flux", "err"]})
```

### 2.6  Restructure dataframe 
- Make columns have band names in them and then remove band from the index
- pivot the dataframe so that SKTIME understands its format
- this will put it in the format expected by sktime

```{code-cell} ipython3
#keep some columns out of the mix when doing the pivot by bandname
#set them as indices and they won't get pivoted into
df_lc = df_lc.set_index(["objectid", "label", "time"])

#attach bandname to all the fluxes and uncertainties
df_lc = df_lc.pivot(columns = "band")

#rename the columns
df_lc.columns = ["_".join(col) for col in df_lc.columns.values]

#many of these flux columns still have a space in them from the bandnames, 
#convert that space to underscore
df_lc.columns = df_lc.columns.str.replace(' ', '_') 

#and get rid of that index to cleanup
df_lc = df_lc.reset_index()  
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
#look at a single object to see what this array looks like
ob_of_interest = 4
singleob = df_lc[df_lc['objectid'] == ob_of_interest]
singleob
```

### 2.7 Normalize 
- this is normalizing across all bands
- think this is the right place to do this, rather than interpolate over time 
    so that the final light curves are normalized since that is the chunk of information 
    which goes into the ML algorithms.
- chose max and not median or mean because there are some objects where the median flux = 0.0
    - if we did this before the interpolating, the median might be a non-zero value
- normalizing is required so that the CLAGN and it's comparison SDSS sample don't have different flux levels.


Idea here is that we normalize across each object.  So the algorithms will know, for example, that within one object W1 will be brighter than ZTF bands but from one object to the next, it will not know that one is brighter than the other.

```{code-cell} ipython3
# make a new column with max_r_flux for each objectid
df_lc['max_W1'] = df_lc.groupby('objectid', sort=False)["flux_w1"].transform('max')

#figure out which columns in the dataframe are flux columns
flux_cols = [col for col in df_lc.columns if 'flux' in col]

# make new normalized flux columns for all fluxes
df_lc[flux_cols] = df_lc[flux_cols].div(df_lc['max_W1'], axis=0)

#now drop max_W1 as a column so it doesn't get included as a variable in multivariate analysis
df_lc.drop(columns = ['max_W1'], inplace = True)
```

### 2.8 Make datetime column
https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#module-datetime

SKTime wants a datetime column

```{code-cell} ipython3
#need to convert df_lc time into datetime
mjd = df_lc.time

#convert to JD
jd = mjd_to_jd(mjd)

#convert to individual components
t = Time(jd, format = 'jd' )

#t.datetime is now an array of type datetime
#make it a column in the dataframe
df_lc['datetime'] = t.datetime
```

### 2.9 Save this dataframe

```{code-cell} ipython3
#save this dataframe to use for the ML below so we don't have to make it every time
parquet_savename = 'output/df_lc_ML.parquet'
df_lc.to_parquet(parquet_savename)
#print("file saved!")
```

### 2.10 Make into multi-index
(which is what SKTime expects as input)

```{code-cell} ipython3
df_lc = df_lc.set_index(["objectid", "label", "datetime"])
```

## 3. Prep for ML algorithms

```{code-cell} ipython3
# could load a previously saved file in order to plot
#parquet_loadname = 'output/df_lc_ML.parquet'
#df_lc = MultiIndexDFObject()
#df_lc.data = pd.read_parquet(parquet_loadname)
#print("file loaded!")
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
#try dropping the uncertainty columns as variables for sktime
df_lc.drop(columns = ['err_panstarrs_g',	'err_panstarrs_i',	'err_panstarrs_r',	'err_panstarrs_y',	
                      'err_panstarrs_z',	'err_w1',	'err_w2',	'err_zg',	'err_zr'], inplace = True)

#drop also the time column because that shouldn't be a feature
df_lc.drop(columns = ['time'],inplace = True)
```

### 3.0 Consider data augmentation

1. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.08295.pdf which has the following github

    - https://github.com/gioramponi/GAN_Time_Series/tree/master
    - not easily usable
2. https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.06758.pdf

3. ChatGPT - give multiindex df function and it will give a starting point for augmenting


Worried that augmenting noisy data just makes more noise

+++

### 3.1 Train test split 
- Because thre are uneven numbers of each type (many more SDSS than CLAGN), we want to make sure to stratify evenly by type
- Random split

```{code-cell} ipython3
#what does the dataframe look like now?
df_lc
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
#y is defined to be the labels
y = df_lc.droplevel('datetime').index.unique().get_level_values('label').to_series()

#want a stratified split based on label
test_size = 0.25
train_ix, test_ix = train_test_split(df_lc.index.levels[0], stratify = y, shuffle = True, random_state = 43, test_size = test_size)

train_df = df_lc.loc[train_ix]  
test_df = df_lc.loc[test_ix]   
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
y
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
print(train_df.groupby([ "objectid"]).ngroups, "n groups in train sample")
print(test_df.groupby(["objectid"]).ngroups, "n groups in test sample")
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
#plot to show how many of each type of object in the test dataset

plt.figure(figsize=(6,4))
plt.title("Objects in the Test dataset")
h = plt.hist(test_df.droplevel('datetime').index.unique().get_level_values('label').to_series(),histtype='stepfilled',orientation='horizontal')
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
#divide the dataframe into X and y for ML algorithms 

#X is the multiindex light curve without the labels
X_train  = train_df.droplevel('label')
X_test = test_df.droplevel('label')

#y are the labels, should be a series 
y_train = train_df.droplevel('datetime').index.unique().get_level_values('label').to_series()
y_test = test_df.droplevel('datetime').index.unique().get_level_values('label').to_series()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
print(X_train.groupby([ "objectid"]).ngroups, "n groups in train sample")
print(X_test.groupby(["objectid"]).ngroups, "n groups in test sample")
```

## 4. Run sktime algorithms on the light curves

We choose to use [sktime](https://www.sktime.net/en/stable/index.html) algorithms beacuse it is a library of many algorithms specifically tailored to time series datasets.  It is based on the sklearn library so syntax is familiar to many users.

Types of classifiers are listed [here](https://www.sktime.net/en/stable/api_reference/classification.html).

This notebook will invert the actual workflow and show you a single example of the algorithm which best fits the data and has the most accurate classifier. Then it will show how to write a for loop over a bunch of classifiers before narrowing it down to the most accurate.

+++

### 4.1 Check that the data types are ok for sktime

```{code-cell} ipython3
#ask sktime if it likes the data type of X_train
from sktime.datatypes import check_is_mtype

check_is_mtype(X_train, mtype="pd-multiindex", scitype="Panel", return_metadata=True)
#check_is_mtype(X_test, mtype="pd-multiindex", scitype="Panel", return_metadata=True)

#This test needs to pass in order for sktime to run
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
#what is the list of all possible classifiers that work with multivariate data
#all_tags(estimator_types = 'classifier')
#classifiers = all_estimators("classifier", filter_tags={'capability:multivariate':True})
#classifiers
```

### 4.1 A single Classifier
See section 4.3 for how we landed with this algorithm

```{code-cell} ipython3
%%time
#looks like RandomIntervalClassifier is performing the best for the CLAGN (not for the SDSS)

#setup the classifier
clf = RandomIntervalClassifier(n_intervals = 12, n_jobs = -1, random_state = 43)

#fit the classifier on the training dataset
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

#make predictions on the test dataset using the trained model 
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)

print(f"Accuracy of Random Interval Classifier: {accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)}\n", flush=True)

#plot a confusion matrix
cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred, labels=clf.classes_)
disp = ConfusionMatrixDisplay(confusion_matrix=cm,display_labels=clf.classes_)
disp.plot()
    
plt.show()
```

### 4.2 Loop over a bunch of classifiers

Our method is to do a cursory check of a bunch of classifiers and then later drill down deeper on anything with good initial results.  We choose to run a loop over ~10 classifiers that seem promising and check the accuracy scores for each one.  Any classifier with a promising accuracy score could then be followed up with detailed hyperparameter tuning, or potentially with considering other classifiers in that same type.

```{raw-cell}

## 5.0 Run pyts algorithms on a single band of the light curves
[pyts](https://pyts.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is a python package for time series classification.

We run univariate classification here with just the W1 WISE band.  This is a change from the multivariate sktime classification above.

+++

### 5.1 Get the data into the correct shape for pyTS

```{code-cell} ipython3
#How many objects are we working with?
#this is repeated here in case sktime is not run above.
print(X_train.groupby([ "objectid"]).ngroups, "n groups in train sample")
print(X_test.groupby(["objectid"]).ngroups, "n groups in test sample")
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
#input to pyTS must be a  numpy.ndarray 
# a 2d array with shape (n_samples, n_timestamps), where the first axis represents the 
# samples and the second axis represents time

#start working on X
X_train_pyts = X_train.reset_index()
X_test_pyts = X_test.reset_index()

# Extract univariate flux values into NumPy arrays and reshape them
X_train_np = X_train_pyts.pivot(index='objectid',  columns='time',values='flux_w1').to_numpy() 
X_test_np = X_test_pyts.pivot(index='objectid', columns='time', values='flux_w1').to_numpy()

#now work on the y
train_df_pyts = train_df.reset_index()
test_df_pyts = test_df.reset_index()

# Extract unique labels for each objectid and convert to a NumPy array
y_train_np = train_df_pyts.groupby('objectid')['label'].first().to_numpy()
y_test_np = test_df_pyts.groupby('objectid')['label'].first().to_numpy()

## 6.0 Conclusions:  
This classifier can be used to predict CLAGN.  The feature based algorithms do the best jobs of having little to no predicted CLAGN that are truly normal SDSS quasars.  We infer then that if the trained model predicts CLAGN, it is a very good target for follow-up spectroscopy to confirm CLAGN.  However this algorthim will not catch all CLAGN, and will incorrectly labels some CLAGN as being normal SDSS quasars.  THis algorithm can therefore not be used to find a complete sample of CLAGN, but can be used to increase the known sample.

+++

### 6.1 Potential Areas of improvement
- Data is messy
    - ZTF calibration??
- Label inaccuracy is a concern
    - mostly SDSS, 
    - but CLAGN papers all have different selection criteria
- Not enough data on CLAGN
    - limited number of lightcurves
    - consider data augmentation
